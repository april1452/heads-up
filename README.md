#headsUp
Bicycle helmets are seen as so integral to cyclist safety that the state of New York has required by law that children under 14 years of age wear helmets while riding their bikes. However, in NYC, the data shows that more motor vehicle accidents occur involving pedestrians rather than cyclists. If it's more dangerous to be a pedestrian, then who should be wearing the helmets?
